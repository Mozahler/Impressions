## Privacy Policy

**No information is shared in any way to any third party.**

During play, the selfie cameras take a video of the user. 
The video stream is analyzed to gauge the rotation of the user’s head while playing. 
This data is used to place a cursor at the spot on the screen it thinks is being looked at and a cursor is drawn using SceneKit and Sprites. 
The data is not saved to disk (or anywhere else) — it is immediately discarded. 
Only documented API calls to SceneKit and ARKit are used.

**The video stream is analyzed live and not stored to disk.**
**The data is never stored in any form and cannot be shared.**
